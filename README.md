# 4Vite - A script that makes your life easier
###### October 2023 <br/> Development by Matheus Ferreira Santos 🇧🇷.

<br/>

### 🚩 - Repository Goal

- [X] **This project will help JavaScript programmers who hate writing the command: *"npm create vite@latest";***
- [X] **Minimize a long command to a short command;**
- [X] **Go viral and earn lots of money 💰🤑💰**

### 🤔🤷‍♂️ - Problematic

You must have, at some point, stopped to think: “Why is it that every time I want to create a vite project I need to use the long command, ‘npm create vite@latest’?”, I don't know about you, but this sucks for me! That's why I decided to create this project.

**This project will help you DRASTICALLY** shorten the "npm create vite@latest" command.

At the end of everything you will go from this command: "npm create vite@latest" to this: "vite create".

AN ABYSMAL EVOLUTION.

### 🖥️ - Supported Operating Systems

As this project is still in its initial phase, and I am developing it in a Unix environment (Zorin OS 16.03), I can guarantee full support for Unix-based systems, such as MacOS or Linux (in general).

However, I will start deploying this script in Windows environments, to cover the entire development community.

Briefly, the supported operating systems are:

- [X] MacOS;
- [X] Linux Distributions.

### ❓❓ - How use this script??

3. Move the "vite" file to /usr/local/bin: ```sudo mv vite /usr/local/bin/```
4. Be happy!
